# ðŸ†• PR Guidelines

1. **Labeling:**
   * All PRs specifically raised to add a website to the list must include the 'Website Inclusion' label.
   * For other types of PRs, make sure to use the relevant labels to categorize the nature of the changes (e.g., 'Bug Fix', 'Feature', etc.).
2. **Manual Review:**
   * Every PR will undergo a manual review process to ensure the quality of the changes.
   * Reviewers will assess the code, documentation, and any other modifications introduced in the PR.
3. **Checks:**
   * PRs will be subject to automated checks, including tests and any other defined criteria.
   * PRs should pass all checks before they are considered for merging.
4. **Website Inclusion PRs Template:**
   *   Website Inclusion PRs should follow this template for the PR summary:

       ```
       ## Website Inclusion

       **Name:** [Name of the Website]
       **URL:** [URL of the Website]
       **Repository URL:** [URL of the repository where the website is being built]

       Additional details or context about the inclusion can be added here.
       ```
5. **Merging:**
   * PRs will only be merged after successfully passing the manual review and automated checks.
   * The maintainers will handle the merging process once everything is confirmed.
