# üöö Deployment Guide

Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner to create a fork of the repository under your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Vercel Account:** If you don't have a Vercel account, sign up for one at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
3. **Connect Your GitHub Account to Vercel:**
   * Log in to your Vercel account.
   * In the Vercel dashboard, click on the "Add New‚Ä¶" button to create a new project.
   * Choose "Import Git Repository" and select your forked version of DIY Portfolio repository from the list.
   * Connect your GitHub account to Vercel if prompted.
4. **Configure Project Settings:**
   * Vercel will automatically detect that your project is a Next.js application.
   * Configure the build settings if necessary. The default build command for Next.js is usually `npm run build`, and the output directory is `./out`.
5.  Setup Environment Variables:

    * Follow the steps in [Creating env variables](creating-env-variables.md) page and add 3 env variables with keys as NOTION\_API\_KEY, NOTION\_DB\_ID, NOTION\_USER\_ID. Replace the values with your values.

## Next Steps ‚è≠Ô∏è

1. Clone your repository locally or go to your GitHub repository page to edit the `data.json` file - follow steps in [Configuring 'data.json'](configuring-data.json.md) page to do the necessary changes to the file.
2. Test your changes locally by installing the requirements using `nmp ci` command and then using `npm run dev` command from the command line of your local repository folder. (Requires latest LTS version of Node.js to be installed locally)
3. Commit and push your changes to reflect in the GitHub repository. The changes will be picked up by Vercel and your site will be redeployed with your details.

   * GitHub will automatically fetch changes from the original repository and display them in the "Syncing" section.
   * Review the changes to ensure they are what you want to update in your fork.
4. **Confirm Sync:**
   * After reviewing the changes, confirm the synchronization or merging process.
5. Make the required changes according to changelog locally and push for a new deployment.
